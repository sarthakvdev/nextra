# Notes on The Hobbit
---

## ⛰ What It's About
> With a wide variety of species like Humans, Elves, Dwarfs, Goblins, Wizards, Hobbits, Eagles, Wolves (wargs), speaking birds, Giant Spiders, and other mysteries, It's a story about friendship, ethics, magic, teamwork and trust.

 
## 🔍 How I Discovered It
I actually know about its existence from quite a time, but planned to read it after discovering the fascinating and brilliant world of *The Lord of The Rings*. I was procrastinating on reading LOTR, but got paperback of *The Hobbit* from a friend and started this instead.

I am happy that I read it prior to The Lord of The Rings as it's chronologically correct.

## 🧠 Thoughts
It's no doubt that it's a great and well-written book but, I can't exactly say I loved it. I mean I enjoyed reading it and indeed it was adventurous, but it is also true that I didn't get hooked or addicted to reading it. I was like yeah it's fun but I have other things to do.

> As I said earlier, It's a story about friendship, ethics, magic, teamwork and trust. And you would definitely enjoy reading it.

## 😄 What I Liked About It
I liked how simple and short this book was.  Even after containing all these adventures, it was concise. It was perfectly elaborate even after being a short (305 pg) read. I've read thicker books. They definitely need more pages to explain things in their way. But the hobbit stands as a solo book, one doesn't need to read other books to understand what it says.

There was a happy ending with a little pinch of sadness, but remorse is needed to make stories feel more real and connecting.

## 🙁 What I Didn't Like About It
I also didn't like a number of things about it. Like, the story could've been a little more explained. When someone writes such detailed stories he needs to explain the world in more details. But I won't blame Tolkien for this, as it was his first book. I also read somewhere that he wrote it as a bed-time storybook for his kids. Explaining its simplicity.

Secondly, some parts were very slow. Which is why it took me 1.5 months to complete it. IKR, pretty high for a 300 pg book.

Thirdly (lol), I wanted more [Gandalf](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Gandalf)🧙🏻‍♂️

## 🥰 Who Would Like It?

Anyone who wants a fantasy book with lots of *adventures, happy memories, loves reading magical stories with large number of characters in it and good world building* would love it.

> Bonus part – It's a small part of a very big fantasy world of Middle Earth Series, so there always more.

> Bonus part:re – You get to read [The Lord of the Rings Series](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Novels) after it.
