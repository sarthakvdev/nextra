# Notes on Ready Player One

## ‚õ∞ What It's About

In 2045, people seek regular escape from life through the virtual reality called OASIS. After the creator's death, a pre-recorded message left by his avatar announces a game. Granting ownership of OASIS to the first to find the Golden Easter egg within it, which is locked behind a gate requiring three keys.

We follow the story of Wade (avatar: Parzival), an 18-year-old schoolboy who wants to find the Easter egg. Along the way, we meet other Egg Hunters (‚Äògunters‚Äô). There‚Äôs also a big evil corporation that wants to find the Egg. So they can take control of the OASIS and turn it into a corporate advertising nightmare. 

## üîç How I Discovered It

I first watched the film in December 2019 and loved it. I didn‚Äôt give it much extra thought after that. Then a few months later when someone told me ‚Äì it was a book adaptation and dwells into [Metaverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse), I ordered the book.

## üß† Thoughts

Really really really good. Kept me up until 4 AM 3 nights in a row. I‚Äôve never been so gripped by the introductory pages of a book before. Usually, it takes a while for me to get into a book. But there was no need for that with Ready Player One.

The story is solid, it‚Äôs got a slight touch of romance, the ending is great, and it feels pretty awesome to read. 

I come from a Blockchain background. Hence the concepts of bounty transactions, owning game assets, and soul-bound possessions were very interesting to me. It kept me hooked, I was finding more and more use-cases of NFTs and Crypto tokens on each page.

But yeah, even without appreciating these technical concepts and the 80's references, this was an incredible read.

## ü•∞ Who Would Like It?

Everyone. You would love it.
