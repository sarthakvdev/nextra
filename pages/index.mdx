# ✨ Hello

I'm Sarthak, I'm a frontend developer with an eye in design.<br></br>
I've experienced building WebApps using React, Next and Tailwind CSS.
With UX Research, mockups and prototyping.

I spend most of my coding time writing logic, styling elements or thinking why something is designed the why it is. When I'm not building, I'm reading [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83877949-sarthak), watching [movies](https://www.imdb.com/user/ur71194765/ratings) or [meeting](https://cal.com/sarthakv/30min) interesting people.

Exploring Blockchain. Its tech is revolutionary and it's changing the way we use and own assets on the Internet.
