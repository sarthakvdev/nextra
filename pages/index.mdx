# ✨ Hello there

I'm Sarthak, I'm a frontend developer with an eye in design.<br></br>
I've experienced building WebApps using React, Next and Tailwind CSS.
With UX Research, mockups and prototyping.

I spend most of my coding time writing logic, styling elements or thinking why something is designed the way it is.
When I'm not building, I'm reading [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83877949-sarthak), watching [movies](https://www.imdb.com/user/ur71194765/ratings) or [meeting](https://cal.com/sarthakv/30min) interesting people.

Dwelling deep into Blockchain. Its applications are revolutionary & it's already changing the way we use and own assets digitally.
